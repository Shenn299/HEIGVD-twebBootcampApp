## FEATURES

* Fetch commits via github username/repository;
* Provide application usage statistics;

## IMPLEMENTATION

The application is divided in two components, the **server** and the **client**.
The first, is used as an entrypoint of the application. All pages are served by
an `expressjs` module. The **server**, has to deal connection between the
**client** and the `MongoDB` database.

The **client** is an `AngularJS 1.x` application. Despite, regular `AngularJS`
app, the project is based on the `angm`, `Yeoman` generator. It's divided into
sub-modules, which represent features of the application.

Depending on the setup, a feature is a MVC application. The controller contains
the core logic.
